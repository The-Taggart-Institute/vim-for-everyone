# 2-3: Shell Commands
---

**In this directory is a file called `creds.csv`. It contains email addresses and passwords from a recent data dump (don't worry; these are all entirely made up).**

**Using shell commands, extract only usernames (without the email domain) for `mydomain.com` users to a new list called `usernames.txt`.**

**Similarly, extract the usernames for `mydomain.com` along with the associated password to a new file called `creds.txt`. Separate the username and password with a colon, like `username:password`.**

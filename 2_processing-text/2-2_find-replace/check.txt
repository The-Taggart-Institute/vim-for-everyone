2-2: Find/Replace
=================

# In this directory is a copy of the epic poem Iliad. You might want to make some copies, because we're going to mess around a bit.

# Insert yourself into history! Choose Achilles, Hector, Helen, Ajax, Agamemnon, or any other character you like, and replace that name with your own.

# In another copy, remove every line with the word "Achilles" in it.

# In one final copy, remove every line that _doesn't_ have "Achilles" in it.
